The Torah is the sacred teaching and central text of Judaism, consisting of the first five books of the Tanakh (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). It contains not only laws and commandments but also the spiritual, moral, and philosophical foundations of the Jewish tradition.

The Torah has been studied for thousands of years — its texts are interpreted, discussed, and passed down from generation to generation. Learning the Torah helps one better understand the history, culture, and worldview of the Jewish people.

You can study the Torah not only through books or with a teacher but also using modern technology. For example, there is a convenient app for studying the Torah available here: https://apps.apple.com/app/id6751901080
